# AirplaneCombatVR
This is a repository for a virtual reality aircraft simulator that I programmed in the two months of my summer break.

### Project Development Progress
In the first month, I was able to create a foundation for a flight simulator, and in August, I implemented it in virtual reality. Most of the physics were coded in July, including the adjustments to lift, drag. Confusing topics such as quaternions and euler angles came up during this stage of development. In August, summer school came to a close, enabling me to focus on the design and implementation into virtual reality using the Oculus SDK.

### Here are some .gifs/ videos highlighting the features that were coded in the game:
